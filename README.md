# kidneywatch
A end of semester project developed over the course of one week. A web app that allows the user to add food to a daily log (postgres) database. This is similar to MyFitnessPal except we specifically track nutrition facts in relation to kidney disease. There is a dashboard with visualizations that show how the user is doing in relation to eating the correct nutrients. This connects to the USDAs public api that serves nutrition facts. The user can search for foods and log them to their daily intake. There are users and user roles that allow you to create an account and do admin tasks.
